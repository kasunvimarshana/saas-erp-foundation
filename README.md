---

Act as a senior software engineer and architect to design and implement a production-ready, long-term support (LTS) modular SaaS application using Laravel (backend) and Vue.js (frontend with Vite, Tailwind CSS, AdminLTE UI). The system must be multi-tenant, multi-vendor, and multi-language, fully dynamic, loosely coupled, reusable, and easily extendable.

Strictly follow Clean Architecture, Modular Architecture, and a Controller → Service → Repository pattern with clear separation of concerns. Enforce SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles to minimize technical debt and ensure scalability, testability, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

Implement tenant isolation (single-DB tenant-ID first, extensible to DB-per-tenant), vendor scoping within tenants, and end-to-end localization/internationalization across backend APIs, validation, messages, and frontend UI using native Laravel localization and Vue i18n with shared keys.

Use thin controllers, transaction-safe services, repository interfaces, DTOs, policies, and tenant-aware global scopes. Avoid cross-module coupling; modules must communicate only via contracts/services.

Implement production-grade security: HTTPS, encrypted data at rest, robust authentication (Laravel Sanctum), RBAC + ABAC authorization, strict input validation, rate limiting, structured logging, and immutable audit trails.

Optimize for performance and reliability using tenant-aware caching (Redis), queues, idempotent APIs, eager-loading rules, and async jobs.

Rely primarily on native framework features or only well-supported, stable, open-source LTS libraries. Avoid experimental or abandoned dependencies.

Deliver a clean, extensible, future-proof SaaS foundation with modular backend structure, modular Vue frontend architecture, clear API contracts, and a testable codebase ready for CI/CD and long-term evolution.

Inventory management systems that handle multi-variant items, batch/lot tracking, and multiple price lists are designed for complex retail, wholesale, and manufacturing operations. These systems ensure accurate traceability (FIFO/expiry), precise stock levels for variations (size/color), and tiered pricing for different customer segments.

---

Managing inventory with multiple variants, batches (lot tracking), and multiple prices requires a robust system capable of handling granular data, such as an ERP (e.g., SAP, ERPNext) or advanced inventory software. Key strategies include using variant configuration to define products, split valuation or batch-wise pricing for cost/price variations, and CSV imports/API integrations for mass updates.

Inventory management systems that support multi-variant products, batch or lot tracking, and multiple price lists are built for complex retail, wholesale, and manufacturing environments, enabling accurate stock visibility per variant (such as size or color), full traceability through FIFO or expiry-based controls, and tiered or customer-specific pricing; achieving this requires a robust, ERP-grade design that models products using structured variant configurations, manages inventory at batch or lot level with batch-wise costing and valuation, supports multiple price lists and pricing rules per customer segment or channel, and leverages scalable mechanisms such as CSV imports and well-defined APIs for bulk updates and integrations, as commonly seen in mature platforms like SAP or ERPNext.
